This proyect is intented to be a personal goal. Based upon the google docs idea of sharing documents and work with them over the internet. In this case, it is to be used under a LAN.

More precisely it will be a login program which can be used on a intranet, for total control access using autentication with a server.

That's the idea, still a pre-alpha XD
